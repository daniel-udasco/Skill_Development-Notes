Module 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals

AI - Effort to automate intellectual tasks performed by humans.

Machine Learning - Rather than giving the program the rules (Traditional Programming), An algorithm find/generate the rules for us.

Traditional vs ML programming:
Traditional - Data/Input + Rules/Steps = Answers/Output
ML programming - Data/Input + Answers/Output = Rules/Steps

Deep Learning (NN) - A form of ML that uses layered representation of data.

Machine Learning vs Deep Learning:
Machine Learning - have 2 layers: Input and Output.
Deep Learning - have multiple layers in between them (transformers).
